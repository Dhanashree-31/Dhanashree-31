            "515   Rice can be cooked in a variety of ways. Personally I find the pressure cooker method quick and effective, that can produce rice grains of different textures - from soft to grainy.

            "756   To begin making the Gajar Pulao Recipe, firstly wash and rinse the rice thoroughly in water (about 2 times). Soak for at least 10-15 minutes in a large bowl. Drain as much water as possible.Fill about half a large deep pan with water & bring it to boil.Add the washed rice followed by 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil. Cook for about 7 minutes on medium flame. Add 1 teaspoon of salt half-way through the cooking process.Keep stirring the rice gently, cook till it’s still a little firm. Once done, discard the liquid from the rice and set it aside.In a non-stick sauce pan, heat 3 tablespoons of oil and add onion paste. Saute the onion paste on medium heat, till its dry and the raw smell goes away. This will take about 2 to 3 minutes.Add the garlic paste, green chilli paste and stir for about a minute. Pour in tomato puree along with red kashmiri chilli powder stir for another 5-6 minutes.Add the carrots, the par cooked rice into the above gravy. Turn the heat to low and simmer for about 15...  \n"

            "Instructions: To begin making the Cheese Garlic Naan Recipe, we need to make the dough to ensure it is well rested. To make the dough in a mixing bowl, combine the all purpose flour, along with the whole wheat flour, active dry yeast, salt, garlic, coriander leaves, butter and mix well until the ingredients are well combined. Now knead the dough with the curd and use the required amount of water to knead a soft dough. Finally add in a teaspoon of oil and knead into a smooth dough and shape it into a large dough ball. Place this in a greased bowl, and cover with a damp cloth and keep it rested in a warm place for about two hours. Once the naan dough has doubled in size, punch down the dough, knead for a minute and divide into equal portions.Heat a cast iron tawa on medium heat, and keep it ready.Roll out each dough ball into a 4 inch diameter, place the grated cheese, and bring the edges together and make a potli, flatten between your palms, dust it in flour and begin to roll in a way that we get elongated, oval naans. Brush water on one side of the naan, and evenly spread it on the entire surface of the naan, now place this naan on the tawa, with the water side face down, quickly sprinkle some chopped garlic, and press it down on the naan, in a way it gets embedded in the Cheese Garlic Naan. Next, after about 40 seconds, flip the tawa upside down, in a way that the tawa is up and the naan is in direct contact with the flame. Gradually the naan , will fall off from the tawa, using a pair of tongs, take the Cheese Garlic Naan from the griddle and cook the other side directly on the flame. Keep moving the naan for even cooking. Remove from the flame, slather some butter and serve hot.  Serve hot Cheese Garlic Naan along with Spinach Mushroom Chickpea Curry Recipe or Tadkewali Masoor Dal Recipe - High Protein Masoor Dal Recipe,  Pudina Pyaz Kachumber Salad Recipe - Mint & Onion Salad  followed by a dessert of Mango Sago Kheer Recipe - Sabudana Kheer With Mangoes \n",

Now make a well in the center of the flour mixture and add the yogurt, salt and yeast mixture.Knead into the flour and until the whole dough collects into a mass. Add a little more water if required to bring the dough together. The dough will be wet and sticky. Wipe your hands clean and oil them. Now knead the naan dough with the oiled hands until smooth , for about 10 minutes; oil your hands more if the dough is sticky. The dough after 10 minutes of kneading will still be soft and pliable. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover the bowl and  allow the dough to rest for 3 to 4 hours until the dough has doubled in volume. Once the naan dough has doubled, punch down the dough, knead for a minute and divide into 12 to 15 equal portions.With a rolling pin, quickly roll out each ball into a 5 inch oval. With your fingers, stretch each round into a 5-7 inch oval. The next step is to cook the naans. Follow either of the below methods.\n",

            "Instructions: To begin making the Cheese Garlic Naan Recipe, we need to make the dough to ensure it is well rested. To make the dough in a mixing bowl, combine the all purpose flour, along with the whole wheat flour, active dry yeast, salt, garlic, coriander leaves, butter and mix well until the ingredients are well combined. Now knead the dough with the curd and use the required amount of water to knead a soft dough. Finally add in a teaspoon of oil and knead into a smooth dough and shape it into a large dough ball. Place this in a greased bowl, and cover with a damp cloth and keep it rested in a warm place for about two hours. Once the naan dough has doubled in size, punch down the dough, knead for a minute and divide into equal portions.Heat a cast iron tawa on medium heat, and keep it ready.Roll out each dough ball into a 4 inch diameter, place the grated cheese, and bring the edges together and make a potli, flatten between your palms, dust it in flour and begin to roll in a way that we get elongated, oval naans. Brush water on one side of the naan, and evenly spread it on the entire surface of the naan, now place this naan on the tawa, with the water side face down, quickly sprinkle some chopped garlic, and press it down on the naan, in a way it gets embedded in the Cheese Garlic Naan. Next, after about 40 seconds, flip the tawa upside down, in a way that the tawa is up and the naan is in direct contact with the flame. Gradually the naan , will fall off from the tawa, using a pair of tongs, take the Cheese Garlic Naan from the griddle and cook the other side directly on the flame. Keep moving the naan for even cooking. Remove from the flame, slather some butter and serve hot.  Serve hot Cheese Garlic Naan along with Spinach Mushroom Chickpea Curry Recipe or Tadkewali Masoor Dal Recipe - High Protein Masoor Dal Recipe,  Pudina Pyaz Kachumber Salad Recipe - Mint & Onion Salad  followed by a dessert of Mango Sago Kheer Recipe - Sabudana Kheer With Mangoes \n",

Add tomatoes, chicken stock and let it simmer on low heat until the chicken is tender.When the chicken is tender, stir in peanut butter, stirring continuously until mixed thoroughly and the sauce starts to thicken.If the sauce is too thick, you could add some more chicken broth or hot water or if its not thickening, add some more peanut butter. Give it a stir and when the chicken is done, serve hot.Serve Peanut Butter Chicken with Lemon Rice on its own or as a side dish along with Srilankan Chicken Curry and Tawa Paratha for a weekend meal.\n",

You can do this in a blender as well, but the dough when worked with hands gives a better texture to the dough.Stir together the warm water, yeast  and sugar until yeast is completely dissolved. Now make a well in the center of the flour mixture and add the yogurt, salt and yeast mixture.Knead into the flour and until the whole dough collects into a mass. Add a little more water if required to bring the dough together. The dough will be wet and sticky. Wipe your hands clean and oil them. Now knead the naan dough with the oiled hands until smooth , for about 10 minutes; oil your hands more if the dough is sticky. The dough after 10 minutes of kneading will still be soft and pliable. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover the bowl and  allow the dough to rest for 3 to 4 hours until the dough has doubled in volume. Once the naan dough has doubled, punch down the dough, knead for a minute and divide into 12 to 15 equal portions.With a rolling pin, quickly roll out each ball into a 5 inch oval. With your fingers, stretch each round into a 5-7 inch oval. The next step is to cook the naans. Follow either of the below methods.\n",

            "Instructions: To begin making the Cheese Garlic Naan Recipe, we need to make the dough to ensure it is well rested. To make the dough in a mixing bowl, combine the all purpose flour, along with the whole wheat flour, active dry yeast, salt, garlic, coriander leaves, butter and mix well until the ingredients are well combined. Now knead the dough with the curd and use the required amount of water to knead a soft dough. Finally add in a teaspoon of oil and knead into a smooth dough and shape it into a large dough ball. Place this in a greased bowl, and cover with a damp cloth and keep it rested in a warm place for about two hours. Once the naan dough has doubled in size, punch down the dough, knead for a minute and divide into equal portions.Heat a cast iron tawa on medium heat, and keep it ready.Roll out each dough ball into a 4 inch diameter, place the grated cheese, and bring the edges together and make a potli, flatten between your palms, dust it in flour and begin to roll in a way that we get elongated, oval naans. Brush water on one side of the naan, and evenly spread it on the entire surface of the naan, now place this naan on the tawa, with the water side face down, quickly sprinkle some chopped garlic, and press it down on the naan, in a way it gets embedded in the Cheese Garlic Naan. Next, after about 40 seconds, flip the tawa upside down, in a way that the tawa is up and the naan is in direct contact with the flame. Gradually the naan , will fall off from the tawa, using a pair of tongs, take the Cheese Garlic Naan from the griddle and cook the other side directly on the flame. Keep moving the naan for even cooking. Remove from the flame, slather some butter and serve hot.  Serve hot Cheese Garlic Naan along with Spinach Mushroom Chickpea Curry Recipe or Tadkewali Masoor Dal Recipe - High Protein Masoor Dal Recipe,  Pudina Pyaz Kachumber Salad Recipe - Mint & Onion Salad  followed by a dessert of Mango Sago Kheer Recipe - Sabudana Kheer With Mangoes \n",

You can do this in a blender as well, but the dough when worked with hands gives a better texture to the dough.Stir together the warm water, yeast  and sugar until yeast is completely dissolved. Now make a well in the center of the flour mixture and add the yogurt, salt and yeast mixture.Knead into the flour and until the whole dough collects into a mass. Add a little more water if required to bring the dough together. The dough will be wet and sticky. Wipe your hands clean and oil them. Now knead the naan dough with the oiled hands until smooth , for about 10 minutes; oil your hands more if the dough is sticky. The dough after 10 minutes of kneading will still be soft and pliable. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover the bowl and  allow the dough to rest for 3 to 4 hours until the dough has doubled in volume. Once the naan dough has doubled, punch down the dough, knead for a minute and divide into 12 to 15 equal portions.With a rolling pin, quickly roll out each ball into a 5 inch oval. With your fingers, stretch each round into a 5-7 inch oval. The next step is to cook the naans. Follow either of the below methods.\n",

            "Instructions: To begin making the Paneer Methi Paratha Recipe, we will first need to make the dough for the parathas. In a large bowl add in 2 cups of whole wheat flour and some salt. Use your fingers and stir in the salt into the flour.Add water a little at a time and knead to make soft, pliable dough. Knead dough for a couple of minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Use the fold press and knead motion to make the dough smooth.Next we will add a teaspoon of oil to coat the dough and knead little more. You want a dough that will be soft smooth and not sticky.Next we will divide the dough into 14 to 16 equal portions. Cover the dough and allow the dough to rest until you the feeling ready.While the dough is resting, lets prepare the filling for the parathas. I am going to be using homemade paneer as it makes the parathas softer, but you can use store bought paneer as well.In a large bowl; add in the homemade paneer. Use your fingers or a fork and begin to crumble the cottage cheese. Next add in 1 large chopped onion, lots of chopped methi leaves, finely chopped green chillies, cumin powder, and salt. Combine all the ingredients well.Divide the filling into 10 to 12 equal portions. This process of dividing and keeping the portions of dough and filling ready, helps you gauge the number of parathas you can make and if you need more or less of the filling.Take a paratha dough portion dust it in flour and flatten it on the rolling board by pressing it down. Roll the dough out into approximately 3 inch diameter circles dusting with flour in between to prevent the dough from sticking to the surface. Place this rolled dough to the side.Take another dough portion, dust it with flour again and roll into approximately 3 inch diameter circle.Now place the a portion of the filling onto the circle and spread it evenly around. Next, take the other rolled portion of the dough and place it over the filling.Press and fold the edges so that the filling does not come out while cooking the paratha. Once sealed press down the paneer paratha with your palms to release any air pockets. And give it a gentle roll with the pin to even it out. Proceed the same way with the remaining paratha dough and filling portions.Now we will get into the final steps of cooking a paneer methi paratha, preheat a skillet on medium heat and place the filled dough.Allow it to cook on medium heat for about 30 to 45 seconds and flip over. Add this stage add a teaspoon of ghee or oil and spread it around the paneer paratha.Flip again, so the oiled side can cook on the skillet. Spread a little more ghee and keep pressing the paneer parathas while on the skillet to cook the paratha evenly from inside out.Do the flipping over process a couple of times until both sides get cooked, browned and crisp evenly. Make sure you cook on medium heat as it allows the parathas to get a crisp on the outside and yet soft texture.Once the paneer paratha is cooked transfer to a plate. Continue to the remaining dough portions the same way.Serve the Stuffed Paneer Methi Paratha Recipe along with a Raita for a wholesome breakfast or dinner.\n",

            "Instructions: To begin making the Butter Naan recipe, in a large bowl add the 3 cups of flour and butter. With your hands, blend the butter into the flour until it forms coarse crumbs. You can do this in a blender as well, but the dough when worked with hands gives a better texture to the dough.Stir together the warm water, yeast  and sugar until yeast is completely dissolved. Now make a well in the center of the flour mixture and add the yogurt, salt and yeast mixture.Knead into the flour and until the whole dough collects into a mass. Add a little more water if required to bring the dough together. The dough will be wet and sticky. Wipe your hands clean and oil them. Now knead the naan dough with the oiled hands until smooth , for about 10 minutes; oil your hands more if the dough is sticky. The dough after 10 minutes of kneading will still be soft and pliable. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover the bowl and  allow the dough to rest for 3 to 4 hours until the dough has doubled in volume. Once the naan dough has doubled, punch down the dough, knead for a minute and divide into 12 to 15 equal portions.With a rolling pin, quickly roll out each ball into a 5 inch oval. With your fingers, stretch each round into a 5-7 inch oval. The next step is to cook the naans. Follow either of the below methods.\n",

Use your fingers or a fork and begin to crumble the cottage cheese. Next add in 1 large chopped onion, lots of chopped methi leaves, finely chopped green chillies, cumin powder, and salt. Combine all the ingredients well.Divide the filling into 10 to 12 equal portions. This process of dividing and keeping the portions of dough and filling ready, helps you gauge the number of parathas you can make and if you need more or less of the filling.Take a paratha dough portion dust it in flour and flatten it on the rolling board by pressing it down. Roll the dough out into approximately 3 inch diameter circles dusting with flour in between to prevent the dough from sticking to the surface. Place this rolled dough to the side.Take another dough portion, dust it with flour again and roll into approximately 3 inch diameter circle.Now place the a portion of the filling onto the circle and spread it evenly around. Next, take the other rolled portion of the dough and place it over the filling.Press and fold the edges so that the filling does not come out while cooking the paratha. Once sealed press down the paneer paratha with your palms to release any air pockets. And give it a gentle roll with the pin to even it out. Proceed the same way with the remaining paratha dough and filling portions.Now we will get into the final steps of cooking a paneer methi paratha, preheat a skillet on medium heat and place the filled dough.Allow it to cook on medium heat for about 30 to 45 seconds and flip over. Add this stage add a teaspoon of ghee or oil and spread it around the paneer paratha.Flip again, so the oiled side can cook on the skillet. Spread a little more ghee and keep pressing the paneer parathas while on the skillet to cook the paratha evenly from inside out.Do the flipping over process a couple of times until both sides get cooked, browned and crisp evenly. Make sure you cook on medium heat as it allows the parathas to get a crisp on the outside and yet soft texture.Once the paneer paratha is cooked transfer to a plate. Continue to the remaining dough portions the same way.Serve the Stuffed Paneer Methi Paratha Recipe along with a Raita for a wholesome breakfast or dinner.\n",

Now knead the naan dough with the oiled hands until smooth , for about 10 minutes; oil your hands more if the dough is sticky. The dough after 10 minutes of kneading will still be soft and pliable. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover the bowl and  allow the dough to rest for 3 to 4 hours until the dough has doubled in volume. Once the naan dough has doubled, punch down the dough, knead for a minute and divide into 12 to 15 equal portions.With a rolling pin, quickly roll out each ball into a 5 inch oval. With your fingers, stretch each round into a 5-7 inch oval. The next step is to cook the naans. Follow either of the below methods.\n",

            "Instructions: To begin making the Cheese Garlic Naan Recipe, we need to make the dough to ensure it is well rested. To make the dough in a mixing bowl, combine the all purpose flour, along with the whole wheat flour, active dry yeast, salt, garlic, coriander leaves, butter and mix well until the ingredients are well combined. Now knead the dough with the curd and use the required amount of water to knead a soft dough. Finally add in a teaspoon of oil and knead into a smooth dough and shape it into a large dough ball. Place this in a greased bowl, and cover with a damp cloth and keep it rested in a warm place for about two hours. Once the naan dough has doubled in size, punch down the dough, knead for a minute and divide into equal portions.Heat a cast iron tawa on medium heat, and keep it ready.Roll out each dough ball into a 4 inch diameter, place the grated cheese, and bring the edges together and make a potli, flatten between your palms, dust it in flour and begin to roll in a way that we get elongated, oval naans. Brush water on one side of the naan, and evenly spread it on the entire surface of the naan, now place this naan on the tawa, with the water side face down, quickly sprinkle some chopped garlic, and press it down on the naan, in a way it gets embedded in the Cheese Garlic Naan. Next, after about 40 seconds, flip the tawa upside down, in a way that the tawa is up and the naan is in direct contact with the flame. Gradually the naan , will fall off from the tawa, using a pair of tongs, take the Cheese Garlic Naan from the griddle and cook the other side directly on the flame. Keep moving the naan for even cooking. Remove from the flame, slather some butter and serve hot.  Serve hot Cheese Garlic Naan along with Spinach Mushroom Chickpea Curry Recipe or Tadkewali Masoor Dal Recipe - High Protein Masoor Dal Recipe,  Pudina Pyaz Kachumber Salad Recipe - Mint & Onion Salad  followed by a dessert of Mango Sago Kheer Recipe - Sabudana Kheer With Mangoes \n",

Let the dough rest for 2 hours, till it doubles in size.Punch down the dough, once doubled and knead for a minute or two.Divide the dough into 6-7 equal portions and shape them into a ball. Pat or Roll out each ball to a 7-8 inch elongated, tear shape. (Keep the other dough balls covered while your roll out one.) Sprinkle some chopped garlic over the Naan and press well.Turn it over and brush this side with some water.Preheat an iron griddle over medium heatPlace the water brushed side on the hot iron griddle.Invert the griddle exposing the garlic side directly to the flame, without directly touching the flame.Move the griddle slowly so that the Naan cooks evenly.In about a minute, the Naan starts browning and you can see a few bubbles.Using a pair of tongs, take off the Naan from the griddle and cook the other side directly on the flame. Keep moving the naan for even cooking.Mix the coriander and mint with the melted butter. Brush the Garlic Naan with this herbed butter and serve Butter Garlic Naan with Punjabi Sabut Moong Ki Dal and Dry Methi Malai Matar, along with Beetroot Raita for a satisfying meal.\n",

After the butter melts, add ginger and green chillies and saute for 2 minutes.Add the spice powders (turmeric powder, red chili powder, cumin powder and coriander powder) one by one and saute till they mix well and are aromatic.Now pour the tomato and onion puree and mix well with spices.Simmer on low flame till oil rises to the surface of the gravy and the color of the gravy changes.Add the chicken tikka pieces and mix well. Add 1/2 teaspoon sugar and mix well.Simmer the gravy for 10 minutes. Adjust salt. Now add fresh cream and Delmonte tandoori mayo, mix and simmer for 5 minutes.Garnish with cream, a knob of butter and coriander leaves. Serve with steamed Basmati rice, Naan or Pudina Tawa Paratha.\n",

You can do this in a blender as well, but the dough when worked with hands gives a better texture to the dough.Stir together the warm water, yeast  and sugar until yeast is completely dissolved. Now make a well in the center of the flour mixture and add the yogurt, salt and yeast mixture.Knead into the flour and until the whole dough collects into a mass. Add a little more water if required to bring the dough together. The dough will be wet and sticky. Wipe your hands clean and oil them. Now knead the naan dough with the oiled hands until smooth , for about 10 minutes; oil your hands more if the dough is sticky. The dough after 10 minutes of kneading will still be soft and pliable. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover the bowl and  allow the dough to rest for 3 to 4 hours until the dough has doubled in volume. Once the naan dough has doubled, punch down the dough, knead for a minute and divide into 12 to 15 equal portions.With a rolling pin, quickly roll out each ball into a 5 inch oval. With your fingers, stretch each round into a 5-7 inch oval. The next step is to cook the naans. Follow either of the below methods.\n",

Place this in a greased bowl, and cover with a damp cloth and keep it rested in a warm place for about two hours. Once the naan dough has doubled in size, punch down the dough, knead for a minute and divide into equal portions.Heat a cast iron tawa on medium heat, and keep it ready.Roll out each dough ball into a 4 inch diameter, place the grated cheese, and bring the edges together and make a potli, flatten between your palms, dust it in flour and begin to roll in a way that we get elongated, oval naans. Brush water on one side of the naan, and evenly spread it on the entire surface of the naan, now place this naan on the tawa, with the water side face down, quickly sprinkle some chopped garlic, and press it down on the naan, in a way it gets embedded in the Cheese Garlic Naan. Next, after about 40 seconds, flip the tawa upside down, in a way that the tawa is up and the naan is in direct contact with the flame. Gradually the naan , will fall off from the tawa, using a pair of tongs, take the Cheese Garlic Naan from the griddle and cook the other side directly on the flame. Keep moving the naan for even cooking. Remove from the flame, slather some butter and serve hot.  Serve hot Cheese Garlic Naan along with Spinach Mushroom Chickpea Curry Recipe or Tadkewali Masoor Dal Recipe - High Protein Masoor Dal Recipe,  Pudina Pyaz Kachumber Salad Recipe - Mint & Onion Salad  followed by a dessert of Mango Sago Kheer Recipe - Sabudana Kheer With Mangoes \n",

Add a little water at a time and knead to make a firm yet smooth dough.Knead well for about 3 to 4 minutes, this will make the parathas soft.Drizzle a teaspoon of oil over the dough and knead for another couple of minutes. Cover and keep aside till we make the rice filling for the paratha.Next, we will combine the leftover rice, chopped onions, green chillies, coriander leaves, red chilli powder, chaat masala, cumin powder, lemon juice and salt. Stir to combine the ingredients well.Now to begin making the Spicy Rice Stuffed paratha, keep some flour aside for dusting. Divide the dough into large lemon side balls.Dust the dough portions in flour, flatten it and roll it into a 3 inch diameter circle. Place the rice filling on half side of the circle and close the paratha by folding it with the other half. Yes its as simple as that. We will have a semi circle oval shape.Press the sides of the paratha down to seal the edges and gently using the rolling pin to flatten it. Take care, the filling can ooze out if the dough is rolled out too thin.Now to cook the Spicy Rice Stuffed Paratha, first preheat the skillet on medium heat. Place the rolled paratha on top and allow it to cook on one side. After about 10 to 15 seconds, flip the paratha.At this stage, smear some oil or ghee to cook the paratha. Cook the paratha by flipping over a couple of times until you see golden brown spots on both sides.Proceed the same way with the remaining dough portions and it is ready to be served. Serve Spicy Rice Stuffed Paratha with Dhaniya Pudina Chutney and Burani Raita for a healthy breakfast.\n",

            "Instructions: To begin making the Hibiscus (Chembaruthi) Neer Dosa Recipe, first soak the rice over night or for at least 8 hours in water.Once soaked, using a mixer grinder blend the rice along with the hibiscus leaves to form a smooth dosa batter. The batter should be of smooth flowing consistency so we can pour it in the tawa and swirl it to spread. This will not be spread like a regular dosaAdd salt and pepper to taste. You can also optionally grind it along with green chillies. The Hibiscus (Chembaruthi) Neer Dosa is now ready to be made. The Neer Dosa is made very similar to the Rava Dosa.To make the Hibiscus (Chembaruthi) Neer Dosa, we don’t spread it on the pan like a pancake or a regular dosa. We pour the dosa batter on the hot pan and it will spread itself creating holes.Note: It is a good idea to use an iron pan, as the texture and the softness of the dosa comes out perfectly with an iron pan.To begin, make sure you have a greased and seasoned iron pan. Grease and preheat the iron pan until it is sizzling hot. When you sprinkle water on the pan; the water will sizzle and evaporate.Once you have the right heat on the pan; pour a ladle of the batter in a circular motion starting from the outer edges. The batter will sizzle and flow to spread itself. Fill in the batter where there are gap, but do allow the dosa to have a few tiny holes. There is no need to sprinkle oil to cook the Hibiscus (Chembaruthi) Neer Dosa.The Neer Dosa cooks very quickly; when you notice the top of the dosa is no longer raw, the Neer Dosa is cooked. The cooking process will take less than 30 seconds per dosa.Slide a flat spatula from the sides of the pan and fold the Neer Dosa into a half and then into another half to form a triangle. Place the Hibiscus (Chembaruthi) Neer Dosa on a platter and continue to make Neer Dosa’s the similar way.Make sure you place the Hibiscus Neer Dosa away from each other when they are hot; as they tend to stick to each other. Once they cool down, you can place them one on top of the other; into a covered bowl and serve warm.Serve the Hibiscus (Chembaruthi) Dosai along with Thenga Thogayal and a glass of Chickoo Banana Date Smoothie for a wholesome breakfast.\n",

            "Instructions: To begin making the Spicy Rice Stuffed Paratha, we will first make the dough. Add in the flour and a pinch of salt into a large bowl. Add a little water at a time and knead to make a firm yet smooth dough.Knead well for about 3 to 4 minutes, this will make the parathas soft.Drizzle a teaspoon of oil over the dough and knead for another couple of minutes. Cover and keep aside till we make the rice filling for the paratha.Next, we will combine the leftover rice, chopped onions, green chillies, coriander leaves, red chilli powder, chaat masala, cumin powder, lemon juice and salt. Stir to combine the ingredients well.Now to begin making the Spicy Rice Stuffed paratha, keep some flour aside for dusting. Divide the dough into large lemon side balls.Dust the dough portions in flour, flatten it and roll it into a 3 inch diameter circle. Place the rice filling on half side of the circle and close the paratha by folding it with the other half. Yes its as simple as that. We will have a semi circle oval shape.Press the sides of the paratha down to seal the edges and gently using the rolling pin to flatten it. Take care, the filling can ooze out if the dough is rolled out too thin.Now to cook the Spicy Rice Stuffed Paratha, first preheat the skillet on medium heat. Place the rolled paratha on top and allow it to cook on one side. After about 10 to 15 seconds, flip the paratha.At this stage, smear some oil or ghee to cook the paratha. Cook the paratha by flipping over a couple of times until you see golden brown spots on both sides.Proceed the same way with the remaining dough portions and it is ready to be served. Serve Spicy Rice Stuffed Paratha with Dhaniya Pudina Chutney and Burani Raita for a healthy breakfast.\n",

            "Instructions: To begin making the Hibiscus (Chembaruthi) Neer Dosa Recipe, first soak the rice over night or for at least 8 hours in water.Once soaked, using a mixer grinder blend the rice along with the hibiscus leaves to form a smooth dosa batter. The batter should be of smooth flowing consistency so we can pour it in the tawa and swirl it to spread. This will not be spread like a regular dosaAdd salt and pepper to taste. You can also optionally grind it along with green chillies. The Hibiscus (Chembaruthi) Neer Dosa is now ready to be made. The Neer Dosa is made very similar to the Rava Dosa.To make the Hibiscus (Chembaruthi) Neer Dosa, we don’t spread it on the pan like a pancake or a regular dosa. We pour the dosa batter on the hot pan and it will spread itself creating holes.Note: It is a good idea to use an iron pan, as the texture and the softness of the dosa comes out perfectly with an iron pan.To begin, make sure you have a greased and seasoned iron pan. Grease and preheat the iron pan until it is sizzling hot. When you sprinkle water on the pan; the water will sizzle and evaporate.Once you have the right heat on the pan; pour a ladle of the batter in a circular motion starting from the outer edges. The batter will sizzle and flow to spread itself. Fill in the batter where there are gap, but do allow the dosa to have a few tiny holes. There is no need to sprinkle oil to cook the Hibiscus (Chembaruthi) Neer Dosa.The Neer Dosa cooks very quickly; when you notice the top of the dosa is no longer raw, the Neer Dosa is cooked. The cooking process will take less than 30 seconds per dosa.Slide a flat spatula from the sides of the pan and fold the Neer Dosa into a half and then into another half to form a triangle. Place the Hibiscus (Chembaruthi) Neer Dosa on a platter and continue to make Neer Dosa’s the similar way.Make sure you place the Hibiscus Neer Dosa away from each other when they are hot; as they tend to stick to each other. Once they cool down, you can place them one on top of the other; into a covered bowl and serve warm.Serve the Hibiscus (Chembaruthi) Dosai along with Thenga Thogayal and a glass of Chickoo Banana Date Smoothie for a wholesome breakfast.\n",

            "Instructions: To begin making the Spicy Rice Stuffed Paratha, we will first make the dough. Add in the flour and a pinch of salt into a large bowl. Add a little water at a time and knead to make a firm yet smooth dough.Knead well for about 3 to 4 minutes, this will make the parathas soft.Drizzle a teaspoon of oil over the dough and knead for another couple of minutes. Cover and keep aside till we make the rice filling for the paratha.Next, we will combine the leftover rice, chopped onions, green chillies, coriander leaves, red chilli powder, chaat masala, cumin powder, lemon juice and salt. Stir to combine the ingredients well.Now to begin making the Spicy Rice Stuffed paratha, keep some flour aside for dusting. Divide the dough into large lemon side balls.Dust the dough portions in flour, flatten it and roll it into a 3 inch diameter circle. Place the rice filling on half side of the circle and close the paratha by folding it with the other half. Yes its as simple as that. We will have a semi circle oval shape.Press the sides of the paratha down to seal the edges and gently using the rolling pin to flatten it. Take care, the filling can ooze out if the dough is rolled out too thin.Now to cook the Spicy Rice Stuffed Paratha, first preheat the skillet on medium heat. Place the rolled paratha on top and allow it to cook on one side. After about 10 to 15 seconds, flip the paratha.At this stage, smear some oil or ghee to cook the paratha. Cook the paratha by flipping over a couple of times until you see golden brown spots on both sides.Proceed the same way with the remaining dough portions and it is ready to be served. Serve Spicy Rice Stuffed Paratha with Dhaniya Pudina Chutney and Burani Raita for a healthy breakfast.\n",

            "Instructions: To begin making the Hibiscus (Chembaruthi) Neer Dosa Recipe, first soak the rice over night or for at least 8 hours in water.Once soaked, using a mixer grinder blend the rice along with the hibiscus leaves to form a smooth dosa batter. The batter should be of smooth flowing consistency so we can pour it in the tawa and swirl it to spread. This will not be spread like a regular dosaAdd salt and pepper to taste. You can also optionally grind it along with green chillies. The Hibiscus (Chembaruthi) Neer Dosa is now ready to be made. The Neer Dosa is made very similar to the Rava Dosa.To make the Hibiscus (Chembaruthi) Neer Dosa, we don’t spread it on the pan like a pancake or a regular dosa. We pour the dosa batter on the hot pan and it will spread itself creating holes.Note: It is a good idea to use an iron pan, as the texture and the softness of the dosa comes out perfectly with an iron pan.To begin, make sure you have a greased and seasoned iron pan. Grease and preheat the iron pan until it is sizzling hot. When you sprinkle water on the pan; the water will sizzle and evaporate.Once you have the right heat on the pan; pour a ladle of the batter in a circular motion starting from the outer edges. The batter will sizzle and flow to spread itself. Fill in the batter where there are gap, but do allow the dosa to have a few tiny holes. There is no need to sprinkle oil to cook the Hibiscus (Chembaruthi) Neer Dosa.The Neer Dosa cooks very quickly; when you notice the top of the dosa is no longer raw, the Neer Dosa is cooked. The cooking process will take less than 30 seconds per dosa.Slide a flat spatula from the sides of the pan and fold the Neer Dosa into a half and then into another half to form a triangle. Place the Hibiscus (Chembaruthi) Neer Dosa on a platter and continue to make Neer Dosa’s the similar way.Make sure you place the Hibiscus Neer Dosa away from each other when they are hot; as they tend to stick to each other. Once they cool down, you can place them one on top of the other; into a covered bowl and serve warm.Serve the Hibiscus (Chembaruthi) Dosai along with Thenga Thogayal and a glass of Chickoo Banana Date Smoothie for a wholesome breakfast.\n",

Add little water and cook till the bottle gourd softens. Allow this to come to room temperature. Combine all these ingredients to a blender jar along with red chillies, half of tempering and tamarind. Blend it to a coarse paste. Add water if necessary. Season it with the rest of the tempering mixture. Serve Bottle Gourd Peel Chutney along with Homemade Soft Idlis or Crisp Ghee Dosa for your morning breakfast.\n",
